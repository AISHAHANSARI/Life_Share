For millions of Americans, they are essential to surviving and fighting cancer, chronic diseases, and traumatic injuries. Every 15 seconds someone needs platelets. Platelets must be used within five days and new donors are needed every day.

It takes only a few minutes longer than donating blood but can have a profound impact.
    Donors with type AB blood make ideal candidates for AB Elite plasma or platelet donations.

    \n•	Donation frequency: Every 28 days, up to 13 times/year*
    \n•	You must have type AB blood

    <string name="process">How does the blood donation process work?</string>
    <string name="process_info">Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others.
        The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.
        The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average. The steps in the process are:
\nRegistration
\n1.	You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).
\n2.	You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.
\nHealth History and Mini Physical
\n1.	You will answer some questions during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.
\n2.	You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.
\nDonation
\n1.	We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
\n2.	You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)
\n3.	When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.
\nRefreshments
\n1.	You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume.
\n2.	After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
\n3.	Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.
\nYour gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days.
        A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.</string>
    <string name="after_donating">What should I do after donating blood?</string>
    <string name="after_donating_info">After you give blood:
\nTake the following precautions:
\nDrink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.
\nKeep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.
\nIf the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.
\nBecause you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm.
        For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.
\nEat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.
\nIf you get a bruise:  Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours.
        Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.
\nIf you get dizzy or lightheaded:  Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.
\nAnd remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!
\nSchedule your next appointment.</string>
    <string name="hurt">Will it hurt when you insert the needle?</string>
    <string name="hurt_info">Only for a moment. Pinch the fleshy, soft underside of your arm.
        That pinch is similar to what you will feel when the needle is inserted.</string>
    <string name="time">How long does a blood donation take?</string>
    <string name="time_info">The entire process takes about one hour and 15 minutes; the actual donation of a pint of whole blood unit takes
        8 to 10 minutes. However, the time varies slightly with each person depending on several factors including the
        donor’s health history and attendance at the blood drive.</string>
    <string name="often">How often can I donate blood?</string>
    <string name="often_info">You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between Power Red donations.
        Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year.
        Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).</string>
    <string name="who_can">Who can donate blood?</string>
    <string name="who_can_info">In most states, donors must be age 17 or older.
        Some states allow donation by 16-year-olds with a signed parental consent form.
        Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health. Additional eligibility criteria apply.</string>
